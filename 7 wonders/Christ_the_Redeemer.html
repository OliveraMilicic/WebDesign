          ➤ History
        </h4>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div class="articleText">
          The history of Christ the Redeemer begins in the early 1850s when Vincentian priest Pedro Maria Boss proposed the idea of a grand Christian monument in Rio de Janeiro. However, it wasn’t until 1920 that the project started to gain significant traction. It was during this time that the Catholic Circle of Rio de Janeiro launched a campaign to raise funds for the statue. The project was envisioned as a way to symbolize Brazil's Christian faith and to provide a landmark for the city of Rio. The design of the statue was finalized by French sculptor Paul Landowski, who collaborated with Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa to build the structure. The construction of the statue began in 1922 and was completed in 1931, with the unveiling occurring on October 12 of that year. The statue’s completion required immense effort, including the transportation of building materials to the top of Corcovado Mountain, which had limited access at the time. The construction was marked by the use of reinforced concrete, which was then a new material in large-scale architecture, and soapstone, a durable yet manageable stone for sculpting. Over the years, Christ the Redeemer has become a symbol not only of Brazil but of the Catholic faith worldwide. It has also withstood the tests of time, surviving numerous storms and natural challenges, reaffirming its status as a lasting cultural and religious icon.

        <div class="articleText">
         Christ the Redeemer is located atop Corcovado Mountain, which rises 700 meters (2,300 feet) above the city of Rio de Janeiro. This strategic location allows the statue to overlook Rio, providing stunning panoramic views of the city’s urban landscape and natural features. The surrounding Tijuca National Park, a vast urban forest, enhances the statue’s prominence and environmental significance. Corcovado Mountain itself is a famous tourist destination, providing not just a view of the statue but of Rio's breathtaking skyline, beaches, and nearby mountains. The geographic location of the statue was chosen for its elevation, which ensures that it remains visible from nearly every part of the city. Visitors can reach the statue via a cogwheel train that travels through the lush forest, making the journey itself an enchanting experience. Alternatively, there are hiking trails for those who wish to embark on an adventurous trek to the top. The area surrounding the statue is also rich in biodiversity, contributing to its status as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The geographical positioning of Christ the Redeemer makes it a central point for tourists and a source of pride for locals, offering a blend of spiritual, cultural, and natural beauty. The combination of urban and natural landscapes at the foot of the statue makes it an unforgettable destination.

          The architecture of Christ the Redeemer is a perfect blend of Art Deco design and symbolic religious elements. Standing 30 meters tall, the statue itself is a symbol of strength, peace, and inclusivity, with Christ’s arms open wide, signifying acceptance and love. The statue was constructed using reinforced concrete, an innovative material for the time, which gives it both structural integrity and durability. The outer surface is covered in soapstone tiles, chosen for their ease of sculpting and resistance to weathering. Designed by French sculptor Paul Landowski, the statue’s face, body, and posture convey grace and serenity, while its monumental scale serves to enhance its religious and cultural impact. The pedestal on which the statue rests is 8 meters tall and houses a chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Aparecida, Brazil's patron saint, where religious ceremonies such as baptisms and weddings are conducted. The Art Deco style is evident not only in the statue itself but also in the surrounding infrastructure, including the access roads and viewing platforms. The monument’s design and its location atop Corcovado Mountain give it an imposing presence, ensuring that it is visible from nearly every part of Rio de Janeiro. It has become an architectural and engineering marvel, with its robust structure having survived numerous storms and lightning strikes, ensuring its durability for generations to come.
